Dice Game
Welcome to the Dice Game! This project is a simple dice game for two players, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Game Rules
The Dice Game is a turn-based game for two players. The objective is to be the first player to reach 100 points. Here are the detailed rules:

Starting the Game:

Each player starts with a score of 0.
Taking a Turn:

On a player's turn, they can roll a dice as many times as they wish.
Each roll adds the rolled number to the player's current score for that turn.
Rolling a '1':

If the player rolls a '1', their current score for that turn is lost, and it becomes the other player's turn.
Holding:

A player can choose to "hold" (save their current score).
When a player holds, their current score for that turn is added to their total score, and it becomes the other player's turn.
Winning the Game:

The first player to reach or exceed 100 points in their total score wins the game.
